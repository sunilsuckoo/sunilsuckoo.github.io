								<p>Hi, I'm Sunil. I graduated from Amherst College in May of 2016 as an Anthropology major. While there, I worked as a Resident Counselor, building community across the residence hallss. Last year, I studied abroad at the Danish Institute for Study Abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. I've spent most of my education engaged in social research, but in my spare time, I like planning events, making posters, and taking on creative projects such as drawing and writing.</p>

As a result, I conducted a research project during the Spring semester of 2013 to investigate how students would interact with one another under incredibly unequal economic circumstances. Using a <a href="http://intervarsityurbanprojects.pbworks.com/w/page/34826230/Manipulated%20Monopoly"> simulation of economic inequality</a> to alter the rules of the board game Monopoly, I observed Amherst College students playing this unfair version of Monopoly. </p>

To explore how diabetes is experienced individually by these institutions and larger structures during the Spring of 2014, I conducted ongoing interviews <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_ethnography"> with a single person</a>, to learn how his everyday experiences as a diabetic were profoundly political. </p>

	                        <h3>Pratt Brats and Shadow Amherst</h3>
							<p> During my first year at Amherst College, two terms, "Pratt Brats" and "Shadow Amherst," emerged with racialized, gendered, and classed conceptions. Through the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Program, I explored the origins of these two new social categories under the advisement of a University of Chicago Sociology professor, <a href="http://sociology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/mcroberts.shtml">Dr. Omar McRoberts</a>. I focused on the use of these terms in relation to the drinking culture at Amherst College. </p>

                           <h3>Office of Residential Life</h3>
							<p>The Amherst College Office of Residential Life staff recruited student researchers to help revamp the current housing policies into ones that would better support the student body. From 2014-2015, I interviewed faculty, staff, and students to understand how to create a policy that would better support students and their medical needs. I focused on the current pet policy, seeking to advocate both for students with allergies and students who require pets out of medical necessity.</p>

							<h3>Feminine Coolitude</h3>
							<p>As part of the Amherst College Digital Humanities program, I designed a Scalar website on Feminine <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolitude">Coolitude </a> after exploring the the lives of Asians in the Caribbean. Throughout the semester, I read literary, historical, and theoretical texts, and I was introduced to several new methods of digital research such as metadata and digital archives. Through these scholarly texts and archives, I focused on the experiences of indentured Indo-Caribbeans. </p>

	                        <h3>Virtuality and Physicality</h3>
							<p>According to a 2013 survey by the Georgia Institute of Technology and International Telecommunication Union, nearly 96% of American millennials are considered "digital natives," having spent five or more years on the internet. The growing ubiquity of technology both solves and raises problems in daily life for millennials. Utilizing methods and theoretical works from Anthropology, Media Studies, and Posthuman Studies, I investigated the complicated experiences millennials have with technology.</p>
